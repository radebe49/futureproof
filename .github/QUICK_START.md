# Quick Start: Deployment Setup

This is a quick reference for deploying Lockdrop. For detailed instructions, see the full guides.

## 1. GitHub Repository (5 minutes)

```bash
# Create repository on GitHub (public)
# Then connect and push:

git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/lockdrop-app.git
git branch -M main
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Lockdrop app"
git push -u origin main
```

## 2. GitHub Secrets (5 minutes)

Go to: Repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Add these secrets:

```
VERCEL_TOKEN              # From vercel.com/account/tokens
VERCEL_ORG_ID             # From .vercel/project.json
VERCEL_PROJECT_ID         # From .vercel/project.json
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS    # Your contract address
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT        # wss://westend-rpc.polkadot.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK             # westend
```

Get Vercel IDs:
```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel login
vercel link
cat .vercel/project.json
```

2. Click "Add New..." → "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Configure environment variables (same as GitHub secrets)
5. Click "Deploy"

## 4. Verify (2 minutes)

- [ ] Application loads at deployment URL
- [ ] Wallet connection works
- [ ] No console errors

## 5. Enable Branch Protection (2 minutes)

Repository Settings → Branches → Add rule for `main`:
