## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-17

### Added
- ✅ Complete end-to-end encrypted time-capsule messaging with Lockdrop
- ✅ Talisman wallet integration (recommended) with MetaMask support
- ✅ Storacha Network (IPFS) for decentralized storage

### Security
- All encryption/decryption happens client-side
- Private keys never leave the user's wallet
- Encrypted content stored on IPFS (unreadable without keys)
- Unlock conditions enforced by blockchain consensus
- Automatic memory cleanup after viewing

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 with TypeScript
- **Blockchain**: Passet Hub (Polkadot ecosystem) via Ethereum RPC
- **Storage**: Storacha Network (IPFS + Filecoin)
- **Wallet**: Talisman (recommended) or MetaMask
- **Encryption**: Web Crypto API (AES-256-GCM, RSA-OAEP)

### Known Issues
- Messages created before v1.0.0 may not have mime type metadata
- Hot reload during development may cause blob URL issues (refresh to fix)

### Migration Notes
- **Wallet**: Now uses EIP-1193 standard (Ethereum addresses only)
- **Storage**: Mime type now stored with encrypted key for proper playback
- **Status**: Message viewed status tracked in localStorage
