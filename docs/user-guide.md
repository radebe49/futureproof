## What is Lockdrop?

Lockdrop is a decentralized application that lets you send messages to the future. You can:

- **Record or upload** audio/video messages
- **Set an unlock time** when the message can be viewed
- **Send to anyone** with a Polkadot wallet address
- **Guarantee privacy** through client-side encryption

Your messages are encrypted in your browser, stored on decentralized IPFS, and unlock times are enforced by the Polkadot blockchain. No corporation or server can access your content—it's guaranteed by mathematics.

### Key Benefits

✅ **Complete Privacy**: All encryption happens in your browser  
✅ **Decentralized**: No central server can access your content  
✅ **Time-Locked**: Recipients can't view messages before unlock time  
✅ **Permanent**: Messages stored on IPFS are distributed and resilient  
✅ **Trustless**: Blockchain enforces rules, not corporations

3. **IPFS Content**: Try downloading CIDs (you'll get encrypted data)
4. **Blockchain Explorer**: View on-chain metadata
5. **Security Audit**: Review audit reports (if available)


## Key Backup

### Why Backup is Critical

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: If you lose your wallet seed phrase, you CANNOT recover your account or decrypt received messages!**

There is NO password recovery, NO account restoration, and NO customer support that can help you. Your seed phrase is the ONLY way to access your private keys.

### What is a Seed Phrase?

A seed phrase (also called recovery phrase or mnemonic) is:
- 12 or 24 words generated when you create a wallet
- The master key to all your accounts
- Used to restore your wallet on any device
- The ONLY way to recover if you lose access

**Example seed phrase:**
```
witch collapse practice feed shame open despair creek road again ice least
```

### How to Back Up Your Seed Phrase

#### Step 1: Find Your Seed Phrase

1. Open Talisman wallet
2. Click Settings (gear icon)
3. Select "Accounts"
4. Click on your account
5. Click "Show Seed Phrase"
6. Enter your wallet password
7. Your seed phrase will be displayed

#### Step 2: Write It Down

**Best Practice: Paper Backup**
1. Get a piece of paper and pen
2. Write down all words in order
3. Number each word (1-12 or 1-24)
4. Double-check spelling
5. Verify the order is correct

**Alternative: Metal Backup**
- Use a metal seed phrase backup device
- Resistant to fire, water, and corrosion
- Available from crypto hardware vendors

#### Step 3: Store It Securely

**Good Storage Options:**
- ✅ Fireproof safe at home
- ✅ Safety deposit box at bank
- ✅ Multiple paper copies in different secure locations
- ✅ Metal backup in secure location

**BAD Storage Options:**
- ❌ Digital file on computer
- ❌ Cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
- ❌ Email or messaging apps
- ❌ Screenshots or photos
- ❌ Password managers (debatable, but risky)
- ❌ Anywhere online

#### Step 4: Test Your Backup

1. Create a new wallet in Talisman (or use a different device)
2. Choose "Import Account"
3. Enter your seed phrase
4. Verify you can access your account
5. Delete the test wallet (keep your original)

### What to Backup

**Essential:**
- ✅ Wallet seed phrase (12-24 words)
- ✅ Wallet password (if you might forget it)

**Recommended:**
- ✅ Polkadot addresses (for reference)
- ✅ Important message CIDs (for re-pinning)
- ✅ Redeem package passphrases (if you created any)

**Not Necessary:**
- ❌ Transaction hashes (on blockchain forever)
- ❌ Public keys (derived from seed phrase)
- ❌ Encrypted content (on IPFS)

### Security Tips

1. **Never Share Your Seed Phrase**
   - Not with support staff
   - Not with friends or family
   - Not with anyone, ever

2. **Beware of Phishing**
   - Lockdrop will never ask for your seed phrase
   - Talisman will never ask for it outside the wallet
   - No legitimate service needs your seed phrase

3. **Use a Strong Wallet Password**
   - Different from other passwords
   - At least 12 characters
   - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
   - Don't reuse passwords

4. **Consider Multiple Accounts**
   - One for high-value assets
   - One for testing and daily use
   - Separate seed phrases for each

5. **Plan for Inheritance**
   - Consider how loved ones will access your accounts
   - Store seed phrase with estate planning documents
   - Provide instructions for recovery

### If You Lose Your Seed Phrase

**Before it's too late:**
- Create a new wallet immediately
- Transfer any assets to the new wallet
- Update recipient addresses for future messages
- Inform senders of your new address

**After it's lost:**
- You cannot recover the account
- You cannot decrypt received messages
- You cannot access any assets
- You must start over with a new wallet

### Backup Checklist

- [ ] Seed phrase written down on paper
- [ ] Spelling and order verified
- [ ] Stored in secure location
- [ ] Backup tested by importing to new wallet
- [ ] Multiple copies in different locations (optional)
- [ ] Inheritance plan in place (optional)
- [ ] Never stored digitally or online

**Remember: Your seed phrase is your responsibility. Lockdrop cannot help you recover it!**


## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: What is Lockdrop?**  
A: Lockdrop is a decentralized application for creating time-locked audio/video messages. Messages are encrypted in your browser, stored on IPFS, and unlock times are enforced by the Polkadot blockchain.

**Q: Is Lockdrop free to use?**  
A: The application is free, but you need Westend testnet tokens (WND) to send messages. These are free from the faucet. For mainnet deployment, you'd need real DOT tokens.

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**  
A: No traditional account needed. You just connect your Talisman wallet, which serves as your identity.

**Q: Can I use Lockdrop on mobile?**  
A: The web app works on mobile browsers, but Talisman wallet is currently desktop-only. Mobile wallet support is planned for the future.

**Q: Is my data really private?**  
A: Yes! All encryption happens in your browser. Your plaintext content never leaves your device. Only encrypted data is uploaded to IPFS.

---

### Wallet Questions

**Q: Why do I need a wallet?**  
A: The wallet provides your identity on the blockchain and holds your private keys for decryption. It's like your digital ID and key ring combined.

**Q: Can I use a different wallet besides Talisman?**  
A: Currently, Lockdrop only supports Talisman. Support for other Polkadot wallets may be added in the future.

**Q: What if I lose access to my wallet?**  
A: If you have your seed phrase, you can restore your wallet on any device. Without it, you cannot recover your account or decrypt messages.

**Q: Can I use the same wallet on multiple devices?**  
A: Yes! Import your seed phrase into Talisman on each device. Your messages will be accessible from any device with your wallet.

**Q: Do I need a different wallet for testnet and mainnet?**  
A: You can use the same wallet, but make sure you're connected to the correct network in Talisman.

---

### Message Questions

**Q: How long can my message be?**  
A: Maximum file size is 100MB. Larger files may be slow to encrypt and upload.

**Q: What file formats are supported?**  
A: Audio: MP3, WAV, OGG. Video: MP4, WEBM, MOV.

**Q: Can I send text messages?**  
A: Currently, only audio/video is supported. Text message support may be added in the future.

**Q: Can I cancel a message after sending?**  
A: No. Once a message is sent and confirmed on the blockchain, it cannot be cancelled or deleted. The recipient will be able to unlock it at the specified time.

**Q: Can I change the unlock time after sending?**  
A: No. The unlock timestamp is immutable once stored on the blockchain.

**Q: What happens if the recipient never unlocks the message?**  
A: The message remains on IPFS and the metadata stays on the blockchain. It can be unlocked anytime after the unlock timestamp.

**Q: Can I send to multiple recipients?**  
A: Currently, each message can only have one recipient. To send to multiple people, create separate messages for each.

**Q: How do I know if my message was delivered?**  
A: Once the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain, the message is "delivered." The recipient will see it in their dashboard.

---

### Unlock Questions

**Q: Can I unlock a message before the timestamp?**  
A: No. The blockchain enforces the timestamp. Even with the encrypted key, you cannot decrypt until the time arrives.

**Q: What if I'm the sender—can I view my own message?**  
A: No. Messages are encrypted with the recipient's public key. Only the recipient's private key can decrypt them.

**Q: Can I download the decrypted message?**  
A: No. For security, decrypted content only exists in browser memory during playback. It's automatically cleared when you close the player.

**Q: How many times can I watch an unlocked message?**  
A: Unlimited! You can unlock and watch the message as many times as you want.

**Q: What if IPFS goes down?**  
A: IPFS is decentralized and distributed. Content is stored on multiple nodes. If one node is down, others can serve the content.

---

### Technical Questions

**Q: What encryption does Lockdrop use?**  
A: AES-256-GCM for content encryption and RSA-OAEP (or X25519 ECDH) for key encryption. These are industry-standard, battle-tested algorithms.

**Q: Where is my data stored?**  
A: Encrypted content is stored on IPFS (via Web3.Storage). Metadata is stored on the Polkadot blockchain. Nothing is stored on centralized servers.

**Q: Can Lockdrop see my messages?**  
A: No. Lockdrop is a client-side application. All encryption happens in your browser. We never see your plaintext content or encryption keys.

**Q: What is IPFS?**  
A: InterPlanetary File System—a decentralized storage network. Files are distributed across many nodes and addressed by content hash (CID).

**Q: What is a CID?**  
A: Content Identifier—a unique hash that identifies your encrypted file on IPFS. It's like a fingerprint for your data.

**Q: Is the blockchain public?**  
A: Yes. Transaction data (addresses, timestamps, CIDs) is public on the Polkadot blockchain. However, the actual content is encrypted and private.

**Q: What happens if Web3.Storage shuts down?**  
A: Your content is on IPFS, not just Web3.Storage. You can re-pin it to other IPFS services (Pinata, Arweave, etc.) using the CID.

---

### Troubleshooting Questions

**Q: Why can't I record video on my iPhone?**  
A: iOS Safari has limited MediaRecorder support. Use the upload option instead—record on another device and upload the file.

**Q: Why is my upload failing?**  
A: Check your internet connection. Large files may timeout. Try a smaller file first. If Web3.Storage fails, the app will automatically try Pinata.

**Q: Why did my transaction fail?**  
A: Common reasons: insufficient WND tokens, network congestion, or incorrect recipient address. Get more tokens from the faucet and try again.

**Q: The app says "Talisman not found"**  
A: Install the Talisman browser extension from talisman.xyz. Make sure it's enabled in your browser extensions.

**Q: My message status isn't updating**  
A: Refresh the page. The dashboard should auto-update, but a manual refresh can help if there's a connection issue.

**Q: I can't decrypt a message**  
A: Make sure you're using the correct wallet (the recipient address). Verify the unlock timestamp has passed. Check that Talisman is unlocked.

---

### Security Questions

**Q: Can someone hack my messages?**  
A: Your messages are protected by AES-256 encryption, which is virtually unbreakable with current technology. The weak point is your private key—keep your seed phrase safe!

**Q: What if someone steals my seed phrase?**  
A: They can access your wallet and decrypt your messages. Treat your seed phrase like cash—never share it and store it securely.

**Q: Can the government access my messages?**  
A: Not without your private key. The encryption is end-to-end. Even if they seize servers, they only get encrypted data.

**Q: Is Lockdrop audited?**  
A: The code is open source on GitHub for community review. Professional security audits may be conducted in the future.

**Q: Can I trust Lockdrop?**  
A: You don't have to trust us—you can verify! The code is open source, encryption happens client-side, and the blockchain is transparent.
