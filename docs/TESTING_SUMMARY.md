## Test Infrastructure

### Testing Framework
- **Vitest** - Fast unit test framework with native ESM support
- **Happy-DOM** - Lightweight DOM implementation for testing
- **@testing-library/jest-dom** - Custom matchers for DOM testing

### Configuration Files
- `vitest.config.ts` - Vitest configuration
- `vitest.setup.ts` - Test environment setup
- `package.json` - Test scripts

### Test Environment
- Environment: happy-dom (better Blob support than jsdom)
- Globals: enabled for describe/it/expect
- Setup: Web Crypto API polyfill for Node.js
- Path aliases: @ mapped to project root

## Key Testing Principles

### Unit Tests
- Focus on core functional logic only
- Test one component/function at a time
- Use real implementations, not mocks
- Verify both success and failure cases
- Test edge cases and boundary conditions

### Integration Tests
- Test complete workflows end-to-end
- Verify components work together correctly
- Test realistic user scenarios
- Validate data flow between modules
- Ensure proper error propagation

### Manual Tests
- Test in real browser environments
- Verify user experience and usability
- Test with actual wallet extensions
- Validate responsive design
- Check accessibility compliance

## Requirements Coverage

The test suite covers the following requirements:

- **4.1-4.5**: Encryption and key management
- **5.1-5.6**: IPFS storage integration
- **6.1-6.6**: Smart contract interaction
- **7.1-7.5**: Sent messages dashboard
- **8.1-8.5**: Received messages dashboard
- **9.1-9.6**: Unlock and decryption flow
- **10.1-10.6**: Media playback
- **11.1-11.5**: UI/UX requirements
- **12.1-12.6**: Error handling and edge cases

## Continuous Integration

Tests are automatically run on:
- Every commit
- Pull requests
- Before deployment
- Scheduled daily runs

## Future Improvements

Potential areas for additional testing:

1. **E2E Tests**: Add Playwright tests for full user journeys
2. **Performance Tests**: Add benchmarks for encryption/decryption
3. **Load Tests**: Test with large numbers of messages
4. **Security Tests**: Add penetration testing
5. **Coverage Reports**: Generate and track code coverage metrics
