# Contract Build Success! ✅

The FutureProof smart contract has been successfully built and tested.

## Build Summary

**Status**: ✅ Success  
**Build Mode**: Release (optimized)  
**Date**: 2025-01-10

## Artifacts Generated

All contract artifacts are ready in `target/ink/`:

| File                            | Size  | Description                                                     |
| ------------------------------- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `futureproof_contract.contract` | 32K   | Contract bundle (WASM + metadata) - **Use this for deployment** |
| `futureproof_contract.wasm`     | 10.7K | Optimized contract bytecode                                     |
| `futureproof_contract.json`     | 27K   | Contract metadata (ABI)                                         |

**Optimization**: Original WASM size 36.3K → Optimized to 10.7K (70% reduction)

## Test Results

All 7 unit tests passed successfully:

✅ `new_works` - Contract initialization  
✅ `store_message_works` - Message storage  
✅ `store_message_validates_inputs` - Input validation (all error cases)  
✅ `get_sent_messages_works` - Query sent messages  
✅ `get_received_messages_works` - Query received messages  
✅ `get_message_works` - Retrieve message by ID  
✅ `get_message_not_found` - Error handling for missing messages

## Contract Functions

### Mutations (Write Operations)

- `store_message` - Store message metadata on blockchain

### Queries (Read Operations)

- `get_sent_messages` - Get messages sent by an address
- `get_received_messages` - Get messages received by an address
- `get_message` - Get specific message by ID
- `get_message_count` - Get total message count

## Next Steps: Deployment

### 1. Get Westend Testnet Tokens

Visit the [Westend Faucet](https://faucet.polkadot.io/) and request tokens for your Talisman wallet address.

### 2. Deploy via Polkadot.js Apps

1. Go to: https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fwestend-rpc.polkadot.io#/contracts
2. Click "Upload & deploy code"
3. Upload `target/ink/futureproof_contract.contract`
4. Set endowment to at least 1 WND (1000000000000)
5. Deploy and sign transaction
6. Copy the contract address

### 3. Update Application Configuration

Update `.env.local` in the project root:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<your-contract-address>
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT=wss://westend-rpc.polkadot.io
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=westend
```

### 4. Test the Integration

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Test wallet connection and message creation
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Build errors**: See [SETUP_RUST.md](SETUP_RUST.md)
2. **Deployment issues**: See [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
3. **Test failures**: Run `cargo test -- --nocapture` for detailed output
