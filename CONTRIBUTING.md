### Contributing Code

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18 or higher
- Git
- Talisman wallet extension (for testing)
- Basic knowledge of Next.js, TypeScript, and React

#### Setup Development Environment

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub
# Clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/futureproof-app.git
cd futureproof-app

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.local.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your configuration

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Development Workflow

1. **Create a branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**:
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Follow existing code style
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   # Run linter
   npm run lint
   
   # Run type checking
   npm run build
   
   # Test manually in browser
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: add your feature description"
   ```
   
   Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format:
   - `feat:` for new features
   - `fix:` for bug fixes
   - `docs:` for documentation
   - `refactor:` for code refactoring
   - `test:` for test additions/updates
   - `chore:` for maintenance tasks

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
   - Go to the original repository on GitHub
   - Click "New Pull Request"
   - Select your branch
   - Fill out the PR template
   - Submit for review

#### Code Style Guidelines

- **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any` when possible
- **React**: Use functional components with hooks
- **Naming**: 
  - Components: PascalCase (`WalletConnectButton`)
  - Functions: camelCase (`connectWallet`)
  - Constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (`MAX_FILE_SIZE`)
- **Imports**: Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix
- **Comments**: Add JSDoc comments for public functions
- **Formatting**: Run `npm run format` before committing

#### Testing Guidelines

- Test wallet connection and disconnection
- Test media recording and upload
- Test encryption/decryption flows
- Test error handling and edge cases
- Test on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Verify no console errors or warnings

### Documentation

When contributing, please update relevant documentation:

- **README.md**: For setup or usage changes
- **docs/**: For technical documentation
- **Code comments**: For complex logic
- **Type definitions**: Keep TypeScript interfaces up to date
