# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Lockdrop is a decentralized time-capsule application that enables users to record or upload audio/video messages, encrypt them locally in the browser, store them on IPFS via Web3.Storage, and anchor unlock metadata on the Polkadot testnet (Westend). The application guarantees privacy through client-side encryption and timestamp-enforced unlocking, ensuring no plaintext media or encryption keys leave the user's browser or rely on centralized servers.
Note: The design anticipates future cross-chain expansion to other Polkadot parachains via XCM (Cross-Consensus Messaging). This ensures Lockdrop can evolve to support multiple networks while maintaining full interoperability and decentralization.


## Glossary

- **Lockdrop_App**: The Next.js web application that provides the user interface and orchestrates all client-side operations
- **Talisman_Wallet**: A browser extension wallet for the Polkadot ecosystem that manages user authentication and transaction signing.
- **Message**: An audio or video recording or uploaded file that a user wants to time-lock
- **Encrypted_Blob**: The AES-encrypted binary data of a Message stored on IPFS
- **IPFS_CID**: Content Identifier, a unique hash that references the Encrypted_Blob on the InterPlanetary File System
- **Web3_Storage**: A decentralized storage service that pins content to IPFS
- **Polkadot_Contract**: A smart contract deployed on Westend testnet (or alternative Polkadot testnet) that stores message metadata
- **Unlock_Timestamp**: A Unix timestamp that defines when a Message becomes decryptable

- **Message_Status**: The current state of a Message (Locked, Unlockable, or Unlocked)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to connect my Talisman wallet to the application, so that I can authenticate and interact with the Polkadot blockchain

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the wallet connect button, THE Lockdrop_App SHALL initiate a connection request to the Talisman_Wallet extension

3. WHEN the Talisman_Wallet connection is established, THE Lockdrop_App SHALL display the connected wallet address in the user interface
4. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL persist the wallet connection state across browser sessions until the user explicitly disconnects
5. WHEN the user clicks the disconnect button, THE Lockdrop_App SHALL terminate the Talisman_Wallet connection and clear the session state

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to record audio or video messages directly in the browser, so that I can create time-locked content without uploading existing files

4. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL support audio-only recording when the user selects audio mode
5. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL support video recording with audio when the user selects video mode

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload existing audio or video files, so that I can time-lock content I already have

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a file through the upload interface, THE Lockdrop_App SHALL validate that the file is an audio or video format
2. IF the uploaded file exceeds 100 MB, THEN THE Lockdrop_App SHALL display a warning message about file size

5. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL support common video formats including MP4, WEBM, and MOV

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want my messages encrypted locally in the browser before upload, so that my content remains private and no third party can access the plaintext

4. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL ensure that no plaintext Message data is transmitted outside the browser
5. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL store the AES_Key only in browser memory until encryption completes, and then immediately encrypt the key with the recipient’s public key before anchoring it on-chain.


### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want encrypted messages uploaded to Storacha Network (IPFS), so that my content is stored on decentralized infrastructure without relying on centralized servers

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL display upload progress to the user during the upload operation
5. THE Lockdrop_App SHALL ensure that only the Encrypted_Blob is uploaded, never the plaintext Message or AES_Key

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want message metadata stored on the Polkadot testnet, so that unlock conditions are enforced by blockchain consensus rather than a centralized authority

4. IF the transaction fails, THEN THE Lockdrop_App SHALL display an error message with the failure reason
6. IF the recipient does not have a wallet address, THE Lockdrop_App SHALL generate a temporary public key and view-only link, allowing recipients to claim and decrypt later after wallet setup


### Requirement 7
